# Warwick Interface for Music Playing Servers (WIMPS)
A standard for music servers to make jam-berets easier.

## Philosophy
WIMPS is intended to make the process of using different music servers at LAN easier by reducing the amount of modification that has to be done to the host computer, as well as imposing some practical restrictions on functionality to avoid problems during use.

For example:
* Music servers should run on Debian 8, because that's what the computer we currently have uses (we can't change this without also changing the internet routing set up as well)
* Music servers need to have a timeout, because otherwise everyone will be sent mad by 10 hour Rick Astley loops
